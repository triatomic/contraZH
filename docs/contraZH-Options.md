# Options.ini

Read at startup. Most can also be changed in game under Options > `Game Options` and apply on
Accept. `NewRadar` and `BlipSize` need a restart.

The menu's drop-down lists share the Resolution list's look and show every entry without a scrollbar.
`build/fix_option_combos_wnd.py` restyles them in `OptionsMenu.wnd` and orders them so each open list
draws over the rows below it; rerun it after adding a drop-down.

## Camera

* `UseCustomMaxCameraHeight = No` - (`Yes` lets `MaxCameraHeight` replace `GameData.ini`'s value, 670
in Contra. Also `Max Camera Height` in Options.)
* `MaxCameraHeight = 670` - (210 to 1000. Single player, skirmish and campaign. Multiplayer uses the
host's limit, or `GameData.ini`'s.)

## Display

* `RenderFPSLimit = 240` - (`30` | `60` | `120` | `240` | `0` for Unlimited. Also the FPS Limit
combo in the main menu's Graphics section. Accept saves the selection; Back discards it.
Without this key, the limit defaults to 240 FPS. VSync can impose a lower cap.
The render rate cannot drop below the current simulation rate, so faster game speeds and
60 Hz online matches can raise a selected 30 FPS limit. Replay fast-forward bypasses the cap.)

* `HealthBarDisplayMode = Classic` - (`Classic` | `Damaged` | `Always`. `Damaged` shows bars only on
hurt objects, `Always` on everything.)
* `AlliedDecalMode = House` - (`Hidden` | `House` | `Army`. Shows allies' general power decals once
fired, tinted in player colour (`House`) or faction colour (`Army`). `Hidden` is retail. Enemy
decals stay hidden. Needs `ComboBoxAlliedDecals` and `AlliedDecalsLabel` in `OptionsMenu.wnd` for
the menu control.)
* `NumericalHealth = No` - (Yes prints hit points beside the health bar, wherever a bar shows.)
* `VeterancyLevel = No` - (Yes draws a gold veterancy icon that fills from bottom to top on the
selected unit's portrait, with subtle current XP / next-rank XP text below it. A single chevron,
double chevron and star show progress toward veteran, elite and heroic. The fill resets after a
promotion and stays full at the unit's rank cap. Mod ranks above heroic keep their existing art.
Non-trainable units show no XP text. Icons above units in the world stay unchanged. Needs a restart.)
* `SelectionCircle = No` - (Yes draws a green ring under selected objects. The D3D9 build draws
a hexagon fitted to the object's collision shape with a shader instead, on cards with `ps_2_a`.)
* `DefensesRangeCircle = No` - (Yes shows an armed structure's widest attack range, upgrades
included, while placing it. Wall pieces get one ring each. The D3D9 build draws the ring with the
same shader as `SelectionCircle`, on cards with `ps_2_a`.)
* `ObjectDecals = Yes` - (No hides ground decals requested with `DisplayDecal`. Independent of shadow
settings.)
* `SmartPips = No` - (Yes keeps ammo and passenger pips visible on own units whenever there is
something to show.)
* `BuildTimerDisplayMode = None` - (`None` | `Seconds` | `Auto`. Countdowns on build queue and special
power cameos. `Auto` switches to MM:SS past a minute. Hover tooltips always show build time,
including power penalties, regardless of this setting.)
* `NewRadar = No` - (Yes gives an RA3 style radar: outlined blips, larger structures, dark
waterline, flat ground in three tones (olive, tan for desert sand, grey for rock and pavement),
256x256 grid.)
* `BlipSize = Large` - (`Small` | `Large`. `Small` is 3/5 px unit/structure, `Large` 5/7. Only with
`NewRadar`.)
* `BorderlessWindow = No` - (Yes runs a frameless centred window at the selected resolution. Also
the Borderless checkbox beside Resolution. `-win` still gives a captioned window.)
* `Windowed = No` - (Yes runs a movable window with a title bar at the selected resolution, like
`-win`. Also the Windowed checkbox beside Borderless; checking one clears the other. `-win` still
forces it on. Needs `CheckWindowed` in `OptionsMenu.wnd` for the menu control.)

Notes:
* A blue bar under a building's health bar shows production progress; on supply gatherers it shows
cargo. Own objects, when selected or moused over, or always with `HealthBarDisplayMode = Always`.
* `Damaged` and `Always` bars and `SmartPips` hide while a script letterboxes the screen, as campaign
cinematics do.
* `NewRadar` cannot hide roads, since they are painted into the terrain textures. Bridges still
draw.
* `SelectionCircle` and `DefensesRangeCircle` need a mod-side `PlainRingSelection.tga` (white or
greyscale ring with alpha).
* `DisplayDecal` needs the `.tga` named by `DecalTexture`; there is no default.
* The `DefensesRangeCircle` checkbox needs `CheckDefensesRangeCircle` in `OptionsMenu.wnd`.

## Hotkey overlay

Draws each cameo's hotkey letter on the cameo.

* `KeyboardOverlay = No` - (Yes shows the letters.)
* `KeyboardOverlayRed = 255` - (Letter colour, 0-255 per channel.)
* `KeyboardOverlayGreen = 255`
* `KeyboardOverlayBlue = 255`
* `KeyboardOverlayBackdrop = Yes` - (Draw a translucent plate behind the letter.)
* `KeyboardOverlayBackdropRed = 0` - (Backdrop colour, 0-255 per channel.)
* `KeyboardOverlayBackdropGreen = 0`
* `KeyboardOverlayBackdropBlue = 0`
* `KeyboardOverlayBackdropOpacity = 128` - (0-255; 128 is 50%.)

Shows the hotkey actually registered, so a dropped duplicate is not advertised.

## Grid hotkeys

Keys each cameo by **its slot in the command bar** instead of its ampersand letter, so keys stay put.

* `GridHotkeys = No` - (Yes keys cameos by slot position.)
* `GridHotkeyLayout = QWERTYUIOASDFGHJKL` - (The options screen offers `QWERTYUIOASDFGHJKL`
(QWER / ASDF), `ASDFGHJKLZXCVBNM,.` (ASDF / ZXCV) and `QWERTYUIOZXCVBNM,.` (QWER / ZXCV).)
* `GridHotkeyUnitOrders = Yes` - (Unit orders keep their own letters.)

The layout splits evenly over the command bar's rows, top row first. Rows and columns come from where
the bar's buttons sit, so any bar shape works; columns past a row's share of the layout keep their
string file letter.

With `GridHotkeyUnitOrders` on, Stop, Guard, Attack Move and Evacuate keep their string file letter. A
grid slot on the same key swaps with them and takes the unit order's grid key. Production buildings
have no such buttons, so the whole grid works unchanged. Off, unit orders take their slot's grid key
like any other button.

## Hotkeys screen

**Options > Hotkeys** rebinds keys and writes them to `Hotkeys.ini` in the user data folder, beside
`Options.ini`. Ported from Zero Hour Reforged.

* Left: **USA**, **CHINA**, **GLA**, then **GENERAL** and **KEY CONFLICTS** (red while any key is shared).
* Middle: a general picker, then the general's heroes, buildings and units as icons.
* A general that picks a path at the start is listed once per path, e.g. Superweapon General:
  Classic and Futuristic tech, Cyborg General: Spiders and Angels. Each entry shows the cards that
  path's upgrade swaps in and leaves out the units only the other path builds. A path is a player
  upgrade on a card whose rival upgrades swap the command sets of the same buildings.
* Right: the picked object's portrait, name and command card, showing slots 1–18 in two rows of nine,
  each button showing its letter. **Quick filter** narrows the icons or commands by name.
* Click a card button, then press its new letter. Backspace takes the key off, Esc cancels.
* Mouse inputs bind like keys, to commands and card buttons alike: the middle button, the two side
  buttons and the wheel up or down. Card corners show `M3`, `M4`, `M5`, `WU` or `WD`.
  * The middle button fires on a quick click that did not drag, so middle-drag camera rotation still
    works. A click that fires a binding does not reset the camera.
  * A wheel direction that fires a binding does not zoom; every unbound combination still zooms, so
    Ctrl + Wheel up can take a command while the plain wheel keeps zooming.
  * A binding fires once per whole wheel notch, so a touchpad swipe does not repeat it.
  * A wheel notch over a menu or list still scrolls it and fires nothing.
* **GENERAL** lists every command that needs no unit (selection, control groups, camera, chat,
  beacons, holds such as Force Attack). **Change**, a double click or Enter waits for a key; **No key** unbinds.
* A hold command (Force Attack, Waypoints, Prefer Selection) also takes Ctrl, Alt or Shift alone:
  press it and let go with no other key. It does not take the middle button or the wheel.
* **KEY CONFLICTS** lists every card with a shared letter and every shared command chord; a double
  click opens it.
* Card borders: gold for the selected button, red for a shared letter, amber for a changed one.
* **RESET TO DEFAULT** restores the selected object's card or the selected command. **RESET ALL**
  restores everything.
* **SAVE** writes the file and applies it at once, also from Esc > Options in a match. **BACK**
  leaves without saving.

A button's letter applies on every bar that has the button. With grid hotkeys on, most slots still
take their grid key; unit orders use the letter set here while `GridHotkeyUnitOrders` is on. Tooltips mark
the new letter.

`Hotkeys.ini` holds only what differs from the game:

```ini
CommandMap SELECT_ALL
  Key = KEY_Q
  Transition = DOWN
  Modifiers = CTRL
  UseableIn = GAME
End

CommandButtonHotKey Command_ConstructAmericaBarracks
  Key = K
End
```

* `CommandMap` blocks use `CommandMap.ini` syntax, plus `KEY_MOUSE3`, `KEY_MOUSE4`, `KEY_MOUSE5`,
  `KEY_WHEELUP` and `KEY_WHEELDOWN`. `Key = KEY_NONE` with `UseableIn = NONE` unbinds.
* `CommandButtonHotKey <button>` takes one letter, a mouse key (`MOUSE3`, `MOUSE4`, `MOUSE5`, `WHEELUP`,
  `WHEELDOWN`) or `NONE` for no key. Digits are left out because they are control group keys.
* Not part of the multiplayer checksum. A block that fails to parse drops the keys from there on.
* Needs no files: the exe builds the screen in the look of the options menu beneath it, adds the
  Hotkeys button right of Shaders when `OptionsMenu.wnd` has no `ButtonHotkeys`, and shows built-in
  English for any `GUI:Hotkeys*` label the string file lacks.

### Limitations

Notes:

* **Grid keys win over bare-letter commands.** With grid hotkeys on, a command bound to a bare grid
  letter does nothing while a visible cameo sits on that letter. Example: Next Idle Worker on plain
  `I` (in `QWERTYUIOASDFGHJKL`) fails whenever a worker or building is selected. Use a modifier
  (Ctrl + I) or a key outside the grid layout.
* **A bare-letter command and a cameo on the same letter both fire.** Without grid hotkeys, the
  command fires on key down and the cameo on key up. KEY CONFLICTS does not report this clash; it
  only checks cards against themselves and commands against each other.
* **Cameo keys ignore Ctrl and Alt.** A card button fires on its letter alone or with Shift
  (Shift batches production), so a card cannot take Ctrl + letter.
* **Only path upgrades show their swapped cards.** A general's starting path choice (Superweapon's
  tech, Cyborg's Spiders or Angels) gets its own entry with the cards it swaps in. Every other
  command set swap, from an Overlord add-on, a mines or promotion upgrade, or a state change, is not
  listed: cards show each object's own `CommandSet`. Letters still carry over to a swapped set for
  every button it shares, but its new buttons cannot be set here; add them to `Hotkeys.ini` by hand.
* **Path detection follows the INI.** A path is a player upgrade on a card whose rival upgrades swap
  the command sets of the same buildings. A mod that builds a choice another way, such as through a
  science or an object upgrade, is listed as one general.
* **Mouse binds have no hold on the middle button or the wheel.** Both fire once per click or notch;
  only the side buttons can hold a command such as Force Attack.
* **Hand edits during a session are overwritten.** SAVE writes the screen's keys, which were read
  when the game started; edit `Hotkeys.ini` by hand only while the game is closed.

## Reverse move hotkey

Caps Lock arms a reverse move for the whole selection; the next terrain click drives there in
reverse, like the `REVERSE_MOVE` button. Pressing Caps Lock again or arming attack move cancels it.

* `TOGGLE_REVERSEMOVE` in CommandMap.ini rebinds it. The Caps Lock default only fills an empty slot.
* `KEY_CAPS` is a new CommandMap key name. The Caps Lock state still toggles.
* The cursor uses a `MouseCursor ReverseMove` block from Mouse.ini if present (e.g. `Image = SCCMove`,
`Texture = SCCMove`), else the move cursor.

Needs a locomotor with `CanMoveBackwards = Yes`. Each selected unit backs up while turning its
rear toward the path, even when units start facing different directions. Tanks keep at least a
quarter of their requested reverse speed during sharp turns, subject to destination braking.
Manual reverse orders ignore `BackwardsMoveAngleThreshold` and `ReverseMoveIgnoreAngleThreshold`.
During manual reverse orders, units check collisions in their direction of travel and yield when blocked.
Packed selections, formations, and routes around obstacles keep their reverse order.
Automatic reversing keeps its existing movement and collision behavior.

## Smart selection

A row of small cameos above the command bar: one per unit type with a count, or one per object for
a single-type selection. Single-object cameos show health, ammo and veterancy. Ammo clips with up
to six shots show segments; larger clips show a continuous fill bar. Up to 16 cameos; counts past
999 show no badge. Reskins share a cameo.

* `SmartSelection = Yes` - (No hides the row and unbinds its keys.)
* `SmartSelectionUseMouse = Yes` - (Yes keeps only a cameo's units on double click, No on
Ctrl+Shift+click.)

* Left click: show that type's (or object's) command set. The whole group stays selected; map
orders go to everyone, bar commands go to the focused object or type. Plain orders (move, attack
move, guard, stop, scatter, cheer, formation, waypoints, enter, dock, repair, heal) always go to
everyone. A building placed from a focused dozer is built by it, with the other dozers helping.
* Right click the pushed-in cameo: back to the group's common commands. Right click another cameo:
drop it from the selection.
* Double click (or Ctrl+Shift+click with `SmartSelectionUseMouse = No`): keep only that cameo's
units.
* Tab and Shift+Tab (`SMART_SELECTION_NEXT_TYPE` / `SMART_SELECTION_PREV_TYPE` in CommandMap.ini)
step the focus through the row.

### Command group row

A row on the command bar frame with one cameo per non-empty command group (1-9, then 0). Each shows
the group's most common unit, its number and live member count. Shown whenever any group has
members.

* `SmartCommandGroup = Yes` - (No hides the row. `SmartSelection = No` hides it too.)

* Left click selects the group; double click also centres the camera on it.

## Action lines

A faint line from each selected unit to where its order sends it, fading in from the unit and
ending in a small dot. Units moving together share one line. Lines last as long as the order and follow a
chased target.

* `ActionLines = Off` - (`Off` | `All` | `AttackOnly`. Game Options > Action lines. `AttackOnly` draws
attack and attack move orders only.)

* Green: move, enter, dock, repair. Pink: attack move. Red: attack. Blue: guard.
* No line draws to a target in fog or shroud.
* A waypoint path draws one line per leg. With `All` it replaces the white path shown while Alt is
held.
* Credit to olcayseygan, author of Generals Reforged.

## Input

* `CastMode = Normal` - (`Normal` | `QuickCast` | `QuickCastWithIndicator`. `QuickCast` fires a
targeted ability at the cursor on the hotkey press. `QuickCastWithIndicator` aims with a decal while
held and fires on release.)

Notes:
* Superweapons, structure placement, rally points and beacons are excluded from quick cast.
* A cast pressed during cooldown is queued and fires when the ability is ready, never earlier.
* Shift+click queues five units. Shift+click a queue entry cancels all of that type; Shift+click a
passenger cameo unloads all of that type.

## Clipboard paste

`Ctrl + V` pastes into any text field: in game chat (Enter, Shift+Enter for allies), lobby chat,
names, and so on.

Notes:
* Pastes obey the field's filters; hidden fields still show asterisks.
* Text is truncated to fit the field.
* A multi-line paste stops at the first line break.

## Command line

* `-loadreplay <file>` starts straight into a replay with menus and Options loaded. `<file>` is a
name in the Replays folder or an absolute path. Unreadable replays or missing maps show a message
box.
* `-loadsave <file>` also accepts an absolute path, and shows a message box on failure.
* `-live` checks the loose file before the `.big` on every read. Without it, a file
first found only in a `.big` keeps loading from there, so a loose override dropped into the game
folder while the game runs needs a restart. Loading opens fewer files without the flag.

## Rendering

TheSuperHackers' texture filter option replaced this fork's version in the August 2026 merge:

* `TextureFilter = Bilinear` - (`None` | `Point` | `Bilinear` | `Trilinear` | `Anisotropic`. Also in
the in-game options menu.)
* `AnisotropyLevel = 2` - (`2` | `4` | `8` | `16`. Only with `TextureFilter = Anisotropic`.
**Renamed from the pre-merge `AnisotropicLevel`** — update Options.ini by hand; the old key is
silently ignored.)

Notes:
* An unknown `TextureFilter` value falls back to `None`, so typos are visible. `AnisotropyLevel`
rounds down to a valid step.
* The level is clamped to what the device supports.
* Fork fixes on top: settings survive a device reset (alt-tab, window toggle), and a driver that
supports anisotropic for only min or mag filtering falls back to linear for the other.
* The terrain follows `Anisotropic` too, blend edges and the lower detail settings included, so distant
ground stays sharp. It used to keep the mod's filtering. In the other modes the terrain still filters
as the mod's `BilinearTerrainTex` and `TrilinearTerrainTex` say.
* Roads follow `Anisotropic` as well. Their mips blend smoothly even with `TrilinearTerrainTex = No`,
and their bump maps stay sharp in the distance.

Shadow mapping, specular, terrain glint, HQ sky cloud shadows, stochastic terrain, normal and glow maps, per-pixel lights, soft particles, flame
and laser shading, per-map colour grading, planar mirrors and the other features that need the Direct3D 9 build are on [Direct3D 9 Features](dx9feat.md).

HQ sky cloud shadows preserve the contrast of object shadows as clouds pass over them.

### Bloom

Soft glow around `Add` blended object meshes, such as building lights, and object textures with
`_emi` glow masks. Additive particles also feed bloom unless their particle system sets `Bloom = No`.
Ordinary opaque surfaces, smoke and alpha blended effects do not feed bloom. Needs no shader support.

* `Bloom = No` - (Yes turns the glow on. Also `Bloom` on the Graphics page,
applied on Accept.)
* `BloomStrength = 0.5` - (0 to 1. 0 is off. The box beside `Bloom` on the Graphics page.)
* `BloomThreshold = 0.0` - (0 to 1. Only source brightness above this value feeds the glow.
Uses the brightest RGB channel and preserves its color. `Threshold %` on the Graphics page,
from 0 to 100. Requires the Direct3D 9 pixel shader.)
* `BloomSize = 1.0` - (0.25 to 4. Multiplies the glow radius. 1 keeps the original size.
`Size %` on the Graphics page, from 25 to 400.)
* `BloomDebug = No` - (Yes shows only the blurred glow buffer on black, to see what feeds it.
`Bloom debug view` on the Graphics page. Cheat builds only: a release build hides the checkbox and
ignores the key.)

Menu controls need `CheckBloom`, `TextEntryBloomStrength` and `CheckBloomDebug` in `OptionsMenu.wnd`;
`build/move_bloom_to_shaders_wnd.py` moves them onto the Graphics page and `build/bloom_row_wnd.py`
puts the strength box beside the checkbox.
`python scripts/add_bloom_controls.py <game-folder>` adds the threshold and size rows and their
labels to the loose menu and string files, keeping copies under the game folder's sibling
`_bak_to_delete` directory.
Cheat builds also let you adjust threshold and size live in the
[`Ctrl + Shift + Tab` panel](contraZH-Debug-and-Cheats.md#debug-panel), without saving them.
The FX tuner's `Bloom` checkbox updates its previews and writes the global `Bloom` setting to
`Options.ini` immediately. Choose that file in the tuner's Configuration page. The game reads the
setting when options reload or at launch; the preview uses its strength, threshold and size.

Notes:
* Replays the glowing object meshes, then blurs the glow at half resolution and adds it to the scene.
* Off while `AntiAliasing` is above 1 on the Direct3D 8 build. The Direct3D 9 build glows with MSAA
on too, and blurs through a pixel shader where the card has one.
* Particle systems can opt out with [`Bloom = No`](contraZH-ParticleSystems.md#bloom).
Their normal drawing and any glow painted into their textures stay unchanged.
* Additive meshes on skinned models (infantry and other bone-deformed meshes) do not glow.
* Retail night models keep their lights in the opaque pass and add the lit skin on top. The game
swaps the two passes at load, so the lights glow and the walls do not.

### Vertical sync

* `VSync = Yes` - (Waits for the monitor's refresh before showing each frame, which stops tearing.
No shows frames as soon as they are drawn. Without the key, vsync is on in fullscreen and off in a
window, as before. Also `Vertical sync` in the advanced display options, applied on Accept. Needs
`CheckVSync` in `OptionsMenu.wnd` for the menu control.)

### Anti-aliasing

* `AntiAliasing = 0` - (Multisample anti-aliasing: 0 off, 2, 4 or 8 samples. Also `Anti-aliasing` under
Detail in the options menu, applied on Accept without a restart; a sample count the card lacks falls
back to off. Needs `AntiAliasingLabel` in `OptionsMenu.wnd` and `ComboBoxAntiAliasing` not hidden
for the menu control. Ambient occlusion is off while it is on.)

### Low latency mode

* `LowLatency = No` - (Yes lets the game prepare at most one frame ahead of the graphics card, instead
of the driver's usual three, so the screen answers the mouse sooner. Can cost a little frame rate. Also
`Low latency mode` in the advanced display options, applied on Accept. Needs `CheckLowLatency` in
`OptionsMenu.wnd` for the menu control. Direct3D 9 build only.)

### Smooth unit motion

The game logic runs 30 times a second. Above that frame rate, units, projectiles and turrets draw
between their last two logic positions instead of jumping once per logic frame, so they move smoothly
at 60, 144 Hz and up. Health bars, status icons, attached effects and the camera lock follow the drawn
model. Only drawing changes; the simulation does not, so it cannot desync.

* `SmoothUnitMotion = Yes` - (No draws units at their logic positions, as before. Also `Smooth unit
motion` in the advanced display options, applied on Accept. Needs `CheckSmoothUnitMotion` in
`OptionsMenu.wnd` for the menu control.)

Skirmish, campaign and replays run the logic at the game speed and render up to `FramesPerSecondLimit`
from `GameData.ini`. The skirmish game speed slider sets the logic rate, 30 being normal speed; the
campaign starts at 30. Mission scripts that set an FPS limit change the logic rate the same way, and
the main menu map always runs at 30. Setting the slider to `--` leaves the game uncapped, with the
logic stepping once per drawn frame, so there is nothing to smooth.

Notes:
* Units are drawn up to one logic frame (33 ms) behind the simulation.
* Single player, skirmish and replays only. Online and LAN games draw as before.
* Teleports, transport and tunnel exits, garrison exits and newly spawned objects snap into place.
* The environment variable `CONTRA_INTERPOLATION=0` turns it off regardless of the option.

### Model animations between keyframes

Model animations advance every drawn frame and blend between keyframes, independent of `Smooth unit
motion`. A bone that holds still and then jumps, such as a runway light stepping from bulb to bulb,
jumps instead of sliding along the runway.

Notes:
* A step counts as a jump when it is at least 1 unit long and more than 4 times the steps before and
after it, so loop restarts and bones hidden by moving them away jump too. Two such steps in a row
count as one jump split over two frames.
* Applies to uncompressed animations; compressed ones mark their jumps in the file.
* Rotation still blends.

### Laser ground glow

Each laser beam lights the terrain along its length with up to twelve dynamic lights in the beam's
colour (house coloured when the laser asks). Terrain only; units, buildings and roads are not lit.
The Direct3D 9 build lights it with a shader instead, see
[Laser ground glow](dx9-Effect-Shaders.md#laser-ground-glow).

* `LaserRef = No` - (Yes turns the glow on. Also `Lasers light the ground` on the Graphics page, applied
on Accept. Needs `CheckLaserRef` in `OptionsMenu.wnd` for the menu control.)

Colour and intensity come from `GameData.ini`, overridable per `W3DLaserDraw` module with
`GroundGlowColor` and `GroundGlowIntensity`. A non-zero module value wins, then `GameData.ini`, then
the default:

* `LaserGroundGlowColor = R:0 G:0 B:0` - (Light colour. Black derives it from the beam layers'
colours weighted by width, times the laser texture's average colour, normalised to full brightness.)
* `LaserGroundGlowIntensity = 70%` - (How strongly the colour is added to the ground.)
* `LaserGroundGlowRadius = 0` - (How far the light reaches from the beam, in world units. 0 takes it
from the beam, as below. Also `GroundGlowRadius` on the module.)

Notes:
* Each light's reach is `GroundGlowRadius` on the module, else `LaserGroundGlowRadius`, else the
laser's `OuterBeamWidth`, at least 15, plus a 6 unit soft edge. Long beams spread and dim their twelve lights.
* The terrain takes up to 64 dynamic lights a frame, of all kinds.
* In the Direct3D 9 build, beams whose glows overlap light the ground together, so a spot several
lasers hit brightens modestly instead of compounding. `LaserGroundGlowOverlap = No` in
`GameData.ini` lights each beam on its own. See [Laser ground glow](dx9-Effect-Shaders.md#laser-ground-glow).

## Drag Selection

### EasyMilitaryDrag

* `EasyMilitaryDrag = No` - (Yes leaves builders out of a drag selection, so boxing over a base picks
up the army without dragging workers along.)

Builders are `KINDOF_DOZER` and `KINDOF_IGNORES_SELECT_ALL`, as for Select All.

`KindOf = NOT_MILITARY` marks any other unit as a builder for this option only. Select All still
picks it up.

Notes:
* Ctrl while dragging selects **only** builders.
* A drag that would select only structures ignores the filter.
