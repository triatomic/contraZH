## Diagonal Movement Speed Fix

All units now move with the same speed in all directions. In vanilla ZH, diagonal movement was faster.

Vanilla behavior can be restored with this parameter:

* `UseVanillaDiagonalMoveSpeed = Yes` - (Default = No)

## Color Tint (TintStatus) definitions

Colors for tint effects (E.g. frenzy) can be defined here. You can define multiple entries for different types.

* `TintStatus = <TintStatusType>  <Tint Color>   <Tint Color (Infantry)>   <Fade in Frames>   <Fade out Frames>`

Example:

* `TintStatus = SHIELDED  R:-0.1 G:-0.2 B:-0.2  R:-0.1 G:-0.2 B:-0.2  30  30`

Notes:
* Colors are defined separately for Infantry. Due to different shading it might be needed to finetune values for infantry.
* Color are defined as decimal number (ranging from -1.0 to 1.0). Values > 1 will brighten the color, values < 1 will darken it.
* Fade in/out frames define how long transition takes when applying or removing a color tint.

[You can find a list of TintStatus types here.](https://github.com/Andreas-W/GeneralsGameCode_Modding/wiki/New-Enum-Definitions#tintstatus-types)

## Viewport fixes
`ViewportHeightScale = 1.0 ; no reduced viewport with non collapsed UI (0.8 in vanilla)`  
This removes the black bar behind the bottom command bar.

## ChronoGun parameters
These parameters configure behavior of CHRONO_GUN damage type, designed to replicate RA2 Chrono Legionnaire logic.

Tint Colors:

* `TintStatus = DISABLED_CHRONO  R:-0.5 G:-0.5 B:2.0   R:-0.5 G:-0.5 B:2.0   10   10`   ; Used when a target is currently being disabled/removed
* `TintStatus = GAINING_CHRONO_DAMAGE  R:0.5 G:0.5 B:1.5   R:0.5 G:0.5 B:1.5   30   60` ; Used when a target is starting to get disabled/removed

* `ChronoDamageDisableThreshold = 10%`   ; CHRONO_GUN damage must reach this threshold of the unit's maxHP to disable it
* `ChronoDamageHealRate = 500`   ; Interval (in ms) in which units recover from CHRONO_DAMAGE after not getting damaged
* `ChronoDamageHealAmountPercent = 10%`  ; "Chrono Health" in percent recovered per interval
* `ChronoDamageOpacityStart = 75%`   ; Visual opacity of the unit when it starts to be disabled by CHRONO_GUN damage
* `ChronoDamageOpacityEnd = 25%`  ; Visual opacity when the unit reaches critical CHRONO_GUN damage
* `ChronoDamageParticleSystemLarge = ChronoSparksLarge`   ; ParticleSystem applied to STRUCTURES. (BOX volume scales to unit geometry)
* `ChronoDamageParticleSystemMedium = ChronoSparksMedium`  ; ParticleSystem applied to everyting else. (BOX volume scales to unit geometry)
* `ChronoDamageParticleSystemSmall = ChronoSparksSmall`   ; ParticleSystem applied to INFANTRY. (BOX volume scales to unit geometry)
  
## Water Depth Terrain Lighting

Note: these keys now live in the map's `MapData` entry rather than in GameData, which is what
previously caused issues when set from map.ini. Set them per map:

```
MapData
  TerrainHeightAmbientLightStart = -1
  TerrainHeightAmbientLightColor1 = R:0 G:0 B:0
End
```

Added support to tint terrain ambient lighting based on terrain height. The main purpose is to darken terrain the deeper it is below the water surface, to create an underwater depth effect.

* `TerrainHeightAmbientLightStart = -1` - (Terrain height at which the effect begins. Above this height no tint is applied. Default = -1 = disabled)
* `TerrainHeightAmbientLightHeight1 = -1` - (Height at which `TerrainHeightAmbientLightColor1` is fully reached)
* `TerrainHeightAmbientLightHeight2 = -1` - (Height at which `TerrainHeightAmbientLightColor2` is fully reached)
* `TerrainHeightAmbientLightColor1 = R:0 G:0 B:0` - (Tint color reached at Height1)
* `TerrainHeightAmbientLightColor2 = R:0 G:0 B:0` - (Tint color reached at Height2)
* `TerrainHeightAmbientLightAdditive = No` - (If Yes, the colors are added to the ambient light instead of blended/multiplied)

Notes:
* The tint blends from no effect at `...Start`, towards Color1 at `...Height1`, and towards Color2 at `...Height2`, allowing a two-step gradient (e.g. shallow water vs. deep water).
* The whole feature is disabled by default (start height = -1).

## Default Excluded Death types

Example:
* `DefaultExcludedDeathTypes = CHRONO`

This means the listed death types will be excluded from any Death module that uses "ALL -XXX" notation. It can be explicitly added by using "+" notation, e.g. "ALL +CHRONO". This can be used to define global exceptions without having to edit every existing death module.

## Scorchmarks on Water

* `HideScorchmarksAboveGround = No` - (If Yes, scorch mark decals are not drawn when their position is above the terrain, e.g. on top of the water surface. Useful to avoid floating scorch marks for naval combat. Default = No)

## Reverse Movement

* `ReverseMoveIgnoreAngleThreshold = No` - (Global override. If Yes, the per-locomotor `BackwardsMoveAngleThreshold` is ignored and units decide to reverse based only on distance. See [Locomotor reverse movement](https://github.com/Andreas-W/GeneralsGameCode_Modding/wiki/Locomotor#reverse-backwards-movement). Default = No)

## Smart Garrison

`SmartGarrison` is a command that distributes a selected group of units across a target transport/structure **and nearby transports** (round-robin), instead of cramming everyone into the clicked one. Triggered by holding ALT while issuing the garrison command (or via a CommandButton with the `SmartGarrison` command).

* `SmartGarrisonRange = 100.0` - (Radius searched around the clicked target for additional transports/structures to distribute units into. Default = 100.0)

## Extra Veterancy Levels

Added two extra veterancy levels above HEROIC (see [New Enum Definitions](https://github.com/Andreas-W/GeneralsGameCode_Modding/wiki/New-Enum-Definitions#veterancy-levels)). Health bonuses for the new levels are defined here:

* `HealthBonus_Four = 0%` - (Health bonus (percent) at veterancy level `LEVEL_FOUR`.)
* `HealthBonus_Five = 0%` - (Health bonus (percent) at veterancy level `LEVEL_FIVE`.)

Notes:
* These extend the existing `HealthBonus_Veteran` / `HealthBonus_Elite` / `HealthBonus_Heroic` parameters.
* See [ThingTemplate veterancy parameters](https://github.com/Andreas-W/GeneralsGameCode_Modding/wiki/Objects-&-Modules#veterancy-object-parameters) for per-object level configuration.

## Weapon Scatter on Water

* `WeaponScatterOnWaterSurfaceDefault = No` - (Default value for the per-weapon `ScatterOnWaterSurface` flag when it is not set explicitly on a WeaponTemplate. Controls whether scattered shots that land on water detonate at the water surface. Individual weapons can still override this via `ScatterOnWaterSurface` in Weapon.ini. Default = No)

## Singleplayer Chat Window

* `EnableSingleplayerChatwindow = No` - (If Yes, the in-game chat window (Enter key) can be opened in singleplayer and skirmish games. This is required to use [Chat Commands](https://github.com/Andreas-W/GeneralsGameCode_Modding/wiki/ChatCommands). Default = No)

# InGameUI.ini

## Generic RadiusCursor definitions

Radius cursors used to need one hardcoded keyword each (`AttackDamageAreaRadiusCursor`,
`AttackScatterAreaRadiusCursor`, `AttackContinueAreaRadiusCursor` and so on), so a new cursor could
not be added from INI alone. A generic form is now accepted, where the cursor type is named on the
header line:

```
RadiusCursor GUARD_AREA
  Texture = SCCommandCenterRadiusCursor
  Style = SHADOW_ALPHA_DECAL
  OpacityMin = 20%
  OpacityMax = 40%
End
```

The old per-cursor keywords still work. The cursor type must be a name from the radius cursor list;
see [New Enum Definitions](https://github.com/Andreas-W/GeneralsGameCode_Modding/wiki/New-Enum-Definitions).

## Radius decals above water

Radius cursors and FX decals previously always projected onto the terrain, so they disappeared under
water. They can now be drawn on the water surface instead — see `RenderAboveWater` on
[W3DDecalDraw](https://github.com/Andreas-W/GeneralsGameCode_Modding/wiki/Objects-&-Modules#w3ddecaldraw-new).

# MiscAudio.ini

The following new entries in MiscAudio.ini are available

*`ChronoDisabledSoundAmbient = <AudioEvent>` - (looping) audio to play when an object is being removed/disabled by a CHRONO_GUN
