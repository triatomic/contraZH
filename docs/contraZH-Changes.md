# contraZH Changes

Changes in [contraZH](https://github.com/triatomic/contraZH), a fork of GeneralsGameCode_Modding.
Everything here is additional to upstream; the rest of these docs still applies.

* Most changes are client-side and read from `Options.ini`; each setting states its default.
* [Gameplay Fixes](contraZH-Gameplay-Fixes.md) are always on and fix retail simulation bugs.
* A few simulation rules are read from the mod's `GameData.ini`; each states its default.
* NVIDIA cards now load DXT1 textures natively, as AMD and Intel cards do. This halves their memory use and makes one-bit alpha visible.
* The map editor has its own page, [WorldBuilder Qt](WorldBuilder-Qt.md).
* A W3D vertex material with `Specular To Diffuse` ticked now acts as a lamp. With [Path tracing](contraZH-Options.md#path-tracing) on, it lights its surroundings with its emissive colour times its texture, by the [lamp formula](contraZH-Options.md#lamp-formula). The checkbox had no effect before.
* W3DView carries the [W3DView+](https://github.com/triatomic/w3dviewerPlus) changes: dark mode, a Material Viewer with a Qt material panel, bone and sub-object overlays, a frame scrubber, a ground plane, MSAA and texture filter menus, folder loading and asset reload. Both viewports also have a view cube at the top right, and the `7` key shows the poly and vertex totals. The asset tree lists one node per object, with its meshes, skeleton, animations and textures inside, and a filter box on the toolbar that also searches mesh and bone names. The Material Viewer draws the light of a material with `Specular To Diffuse` ticked. W3DView also answers a local MCP server that reads a model's meshes, counts, W3D properties, passes, vertex materials, shaders, textures and texture paths, opens a model, lists its animations and jumps to a frame, searches and hides its meshes, and screenshots it from view cube sides; see [W3DView](contraZH-W3DView.md).
* On laptops with two GPUs, the game, WorldBuilder and GUIEdit ask the NVIDIA or AMD driver to run them on the dedicated GPU.
* Synced with TheSuperHackers/GeneralsGameCode as of August 2026 and with GeneralsGameCode_Modding
as of October 2026. The only casualty was the texture filter option, replaced by TheSuperHackers'
version - see [Rendering](contraZH-Options.md#rendering) for the renamed `AnisotropyLevel` key.
* Upstream's WorldBuilder MCP server is not included; contraZH has its own, see
[MCP Server](WorldBuilder-Qt-MCP.md).
