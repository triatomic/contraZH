# SpecialPower.ini

## New Special Power Enums:
* SPECIAL_ION_CANNON
* SPECIAL_CLUSTER_MISSILE
* SPECIAL_SUNSTORM_MISSILE
* SPECIAL_METEOR_STRIKE
* SPECIAL_PUNISHER_CANNON
* SPECIAL_CHEMICAL_MISSILE
* SPECIAL_CHRONOSPHERE

## New Parser Fields:
`BehaviorEnum = <OTHER ENUM>`  
Used to set how a new SpecialPower behaves, new enums will be like "SPECIAL_NEUTRON_MISSILE", with this field another behavior can be set, there is a lot of hardcoded stuff in the exe.

`EvaDetectedOwn = <Name of eva event>`  
`EvaDetectedAlly = <Name of eva event>`  
`EvaDetectedEnemy = <Name of eva event>`  
`EvaLaunchedOwn = <Name of eva event>`  
`EvaLaunchedAlly = <Name of eva event>`  
`EvaLaunchedEnemy = <Name of eva event>`  
`EvaReadyOwn = <Name of eva event>`  
`EvaReadyAlly = <Name of eva event>`  
`EvaReadyEnemy = <Name of eva event>`  
These allow to specify eva events for a special power. When not set, vanilla special power still have their hardcoded events. 

`Cost = 0`  
Optional credits cost to activate the special power. When set (> 0), the player must have enough money, and the cost is deducted when the power is fired. The command button is disabled/greyed out when the player cannot afford it, and the cost is shown in the button tooltip. Default = 0 (free).

`NeedsTargetDesignator = No`  
When Yes, this special power can only be fired while a valid target designator is active for the player (see the [SpecialPowerDesignatorUpdate](https://github.com/Andreas-W/GeneralsGameCode_Modding/wiki/Objects-&-Modules#specialpowerdesignatorupdate-new) module). Used to gate a superweapon behind a "designate target" unit/ability. Default = No.

`StartCooldownOnFirstShot = No`  
When Yes, `ReloadTime` starts once the shots this power's OCL orders are away, rather than the moment the power is used. The power is locked meanwhile: the cameo reads unavailable and it cannot be triggered again. Intended for an OCL with an `Attack` nugget, where the caster takes time to line up and fire. Default = No.

`StartCooldownTimeout = 0`  
In milliseconds. How long to wait for those shots before starting the cooldown anyway, so a power can never be stranded. `0` means use this power's own `ReloadTime`. Only read when `StartCooldownOnFirstShot = Yes`. A use that fires nothing at all is treated as cancelled and the power is handed back ready, rather than charged a cooldown.

### Code Example: 
```
SpecialPower SupW_SpecialPowerChronoSphere
  Enum = SPECIAL_CHRONOSPHERE ; new Enum constant
  ReloadTime = 240000     ; in milliseconds
  PublicTimer = Yes
  InitiateAtLocationSound = ChronoSphereTargetInitiateSound
  SharedSyncedTimer = No
  RadiusCursorRadius = 50
  ShortcutPower = Yes     ; Capable of being fired by the side-bar shortcut.
  AcademyClassify = ACT_SUPERPOWER     ; Considered a powerful special power that a player could fire. Not for simpler unit based powers.
  BehaviorEnum = SPECIAL_SNEAK_ATTACK ; behave like sneak attack, required for chronosphere
  EvaDetectedEnemy = SUPERWEAPONDETECTED_ENEMY_CHRONOSPHERE ; Vanilla superweapons have these 5 eva events, define events in Eva.ini
  EvaLaunchedOwn = SUPERWEAPONLAUNCHED_OWN_CHRONOSPHERE
  EvaLaunchedAlly = SUPERWEAPONLAUNCHED_ALLY_CHRONOSPHERE
  EvaLaunchedEnemy = SUPERWEAPONLAUNCHED_ENEMY_CHRONOSPHERE
  EvaReadyOwn = SUPERWEAPONREADY_OWN_CHRONOSPHERE
End
```

# CommandButton.ini

## Multi-Target Special Powers

Added CommandButton parameters to let a special power be aimed at **multiple target points** in one activation (used together with the [MultiLocationSpecialPowerUpdate](https://github.com/Andreas-W/GeneralsGameCode_Modding/wiki/Objects-&-Modules#multilocationspecialpowerupdate-new) module). The player places an anchor and then several target points.

* `NumberOfTargets = 1` - (How many target points the player must place for this power.)
* `TargetRadius = 0.0` - (Radius cursor shown at each target point.)
* `TargetDecalRadius = 0.0` - (Radius of the decal drawn at each placed target point.)
* `TargetRadiusMode = <mode>` - (How the target radius is interpreted/displayed.)
* `AnchorRadius = 0.0` - (Radius around the initial anchor point within which targets must be placed.)
* `AnchorDecalRadius = 0.0` - (Radius of the decal drawn at the anchor point.)
* `AnchorRadiusCursorType = <RadiusCursor>` - (Radius cursor type shown for the anchor.)
* `MarkerObject = <ObjectTemplate>` - (Object placed as a visual marker at each confirmed target point.)
* `MarkerFX = <FXList>` - (FXList played at each confirmed target point.)
* `SecondCursorName = <cursor>` - (Mouse cursor used while placing the additional target points, after the anchor.)

# New SpecialPower "Kodiak"
based on spectre gunship, a unit with multiple turrets and a primary weapon are fired in the target area
* **MainTurrets**: Follow manual targetting (spectre)
* **SideTurrets**: Auto-Acquire targets (cheap first)
* **AATurrets**: Auto-Acquire targets
* **MainWeapon**: Primary Weapon of the gunship itself that is fired when ready. Has it's own scatter pattern and option to lock on to targets within a radius of scatter impact. Scatter Pattern is in KodiakUpdate, the weapon itself should not have a scatter radius or scatter targets. The Kodiak update will try to fire the weapon when ready going through scatter targets in same order. Use a clipsize. If clipreloadtime is smaller than OrbitTime, the weapon is fired again.

All turrets must be contained objects, this allows individual attack orders. 

Example Code in the gunship unit:
```
 Behavior = SpecialAbility ModuleTag_32
    SpecialPowerTemplate = ZSupW_SuperweaponKodiakGunship
    UpdateModuleStartsAttack = Yes

    ; during TurretRecenterTimeBeforeExit and InitialAttackDelay DOOR_1_CLOSING and DOOR_1_OPENING animations are played
