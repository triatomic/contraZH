# FXList
*This refers to FXList definitions in FXList.ini* 

## ParticleSystem entries
*This refers to ParticleSystem entries within an FXList definition in FXList.ini*

### Added Alignment Parameters

Note: By default, FXList without "OrientToObject = Yes" will not have their offset aligned to the parent object anymore. This prevents the issue of large effects like Nuke mushroom clouds to be "drifting away".

* `OrientOffset = No` - Restores vanilla behavior by always orienting the Offset to the parent object (not recommended, this mainly exists for compatibility)
* `OrientXY = No` - Like OrientToObject, but keeps the Z axis aligned upwards. Useful for directional impact effects that have an upwards cloud component.

### Height and Surface Restrictions

Added parameters to restrict when a ParticleSystem nugget is played, based on the height above terrain and the surface type underneath. Mainly intended for naval/water effects.

* `MinAllowedHeight = <height>` - (The effect is skipped if its Z offset above the terrain is below this value. Default = no limit)
* `MaxAllowedHeight = <height>` - (The effect is skipped if its Z offset above the terrain is above this value. Default = no limit)
* `AllowedSurface = ALL` - (Restrict the effect to a surface type. Default = ALL)
  - `ALL` - no restriction (default)
  - `LAND` - only play over land
  - `WATER` - only play over water (also skips bridges)

## Sound entries
*This refers to Sound entries within an FXList definition in FXList.ini*

### Height and Surface Restrictions

The same restrictions as for ParticleSystem nuggets (see above) were added for Sound nuggets:

* `MinAllowedHeight = <height>` - (Skip the sound if its Z offset above terrain is below this value. Default = no limit)
* `MaxAllowedHeight = <height>` - (Skip the sound if its Z offset above terrain is above this value. Default = no limit)
* `AllowedSurface = ALL` - (`ALL` / `LAND` / `WATER`; restrict the sound to a surface type. Default = ALL)

## Decal entries
*This refers to a new `Decal` nugget within an FXList definition in FXList.ini*

Added a new FX nugget that spawns a ground decal at the FX location. The decal itself is an object template that uses the new [W3DDecalDraw](https://github.com/Andreas-W/GeneralsGameCode_Modding/wiki/Objects-&-Modules#w3ddecaldraw-new) module.

* `DecalName = <ObjectTemplate>` - (Name of the object template to spawn for the decal. Default = `GenericDecal`)
* `Lifetime = <ms>` - (Lifetime of the decal in milliseconds)
* `Offset = X:0 Y:0 Z:0` - (Offset of the decal relative to the FX location)
* `Angle = 0.0` - (Fixed rotation angle of the decal)
* `RandomAngle = No` - (If Yes, use a random rotation angle instead of `Angle`)
* `OrientToObject = No` - (If Yes, orient the decal to the parent object's facing)
* `Probability = 1.0` - (Chance (0.0 - 1.0) for the decal to be created)
* `Scale = 1.0 1.0` - (Random variable scaling the decal's size. Use two values for a random range)

Example:
```
FXList FX_ScorchDecal
  Decal
    DecalName = ScorchDecalSmall
    Lifetime = 20000
    RandomAngle = Yes
    Probability = 0.5
  End
End
```
