## ArmorExtend
Allows to inherit an Armor set from another one. The parent must be defined before

### Syntax:
`ArmorExtend newArmorName ParentArmor`

this will copy all values from Parent before parsing the new values. Do not use `Armor = DEFAULT` as this will set all damage types to this value and overrides inherited values.

### Coding example:
```
ArmorExtend TruckArmorExtended TruckArmor ; creates new TruckArmorExtended which inherits all values from TruckArmor
  Armor = SMALL_ARMS 5000% ; set a new value to SMALL_ARMS
End
```

ArmorExtend also allows to use ArmorMult instead of armor, this will multiply the armor value inherited by the parent with this factor
###
```
ArmorExtend DozerArmorExtended DozerArmor
  ArmorMult = EXPLOSION 1%
End
```
