# Generals Online port notes

This directory holds the online-system replacement ported from
GeneralsOnlineDevelopmentTeam/GameClient ("GO"), a TheSuperHackers-derived fork that
replaced GameSpy with a modern stack (REST + WebSocket backend, Valve
GameNetworkingSockets ICE P2P transport, lobbies/matchmaking/stats).

## Provenance

- Ported from GO commit: `d7f75517dd76c3a4e3de75e988f328a6877621c5` (2026-08-24);
  re-synced to `9c1121bd5` (2026-09) including the 60 Hz simulation and engine-feel changes
  listed under "Decisions made during the port"; re-synced to `6ff404436` (2026-10-05) by
  cherry-picks, see "Not taken in the 2026-10 sync"
- GO's merge base with TheSuperHackers: `e760b3695` (2026-07-26)
- contraZH's merge base with TheSuperHackers at port time: `5943d3856` (== tsh HEAD)
- Future re-syncs: `git fetch go && git diff -w <old-go-sha>..<new-go-sha> -- <ported
  paths>`, applied per the rules below.

## Port decisions

1. Online system plus GO's engine-feel fork (60 Hz sim, frame pacing, widescreen,
   observer overlay, crash guards, stats exporter). GO's unguarded gameplay/balance
   edits, the community patch BIG and the GameMemory relocation are NOT ported.
2. GameSpy stays. Everything is gated behind the CMake option
   `RTS_BUILD_GENERALS_ONLINE` (default OFF). The OFF build must stay byte-identical in
   behavior; every in-place edit to a shared file must sit inside
   `#if defined(GENERALS_ONLINE)`.
3. Telemetry off by default: Sentry behind `GENERALS_ONLINE_SENTRY`, hardware
   fingerprinting behind `GENERALS_ONLINE_HW_FINGERPRINT`, anti-cheat behind
   `GENERALS_ONLINE_USE_PLUGINS_INTERFACE` — all undefined by default, kept in the
   protocol so official-server coordination can re-enable them.
4. Exe name stays `generalszh`; GO's rename is not taken.

## Merge rules (apply to every file brought over)

- Diff GO with `-w` always: its tree carries heavy CRLF churn and `nullptr`->`NULL`
  reversions of TSH modernization. Discard modernization-revert hunks.
- `#else` (non-GO) branches always keep contraZH's text, never GO's — GO's dead branches
  contain code that does not compile (e.g. `m_fpsAverages` in ConnectionManager.cpp).
- Every GO include added to a Core/ file must be wrapped in
  `#if defined(GENERALS_ONLINE)` and use a full `GameNetwork/GeneralsOnline/...` path
  (GO's unguarded relative includes break the Generals (vanilla) build).
- UI screens are dual-copied (GO's versions live in `.../Menus/GeneralsOnline/`), never
  merged in place: GO rewrote them with direct NGMP calls that cannot compile against
  GameSpy.
- `InGameUI.{h,cpp}` are never merged from GO — adapt GO call sites to contraZH's API.
- Blind file copies of any GO-touched gameplay file are forbidden — GO's balance changes
  are mostly unguarded.

## Decisions made during the port (deviations from upstream GO)

- **60 Hz client**: the simulation runs at 60 Hz like the official client (client id
  `gen_online_60hz`, `GENERALS_ONLINE_HIGH_FPS_LIMIT` 60). The switch
  `GENERALS_ONLINE_HIGH_FPS_SERVER` is defined by `GeneralsMD/Code/CMakeLists.txt` next to
  `GENERALS_ONLINE`, not by NextGenMP_defines.h, because `WWSyncPerSecond` lives in
  WWLib's `WWCommon.h` and that static library cannot include GO headers. `GameCommon.h`
  includes NextGenMP_defines.h under `GENERALS_ONLINE` so every engine TU sees the
  HIGH_FPS macros (upstream gets the same effect from its PCH). Deviations from GO's
  60 Hz code:
  - `GameLogic::getFrameLegacy()` / `HasLegacyFrameAdvanced()` are derived from `m_frame`
    and the frame multiplier instead of two stored counters with a hardcoded `% 2`; nothing
    new is zeroed or xfer'd. The unused `getFrameLegacyLast()` is not ported.
  - `GameClient`'s wall-clock legacy counter uses `std::chrono::steady_clock` and a
    `MSEC_PER_SECOND / BaseFps` tick instead of `utc_clock` and a literal 33.
  - The FramePacer render floor and `FrameMetrics::init()` seeds are guarded on
    `HIGH_FPS_SERVER` and use `LOGICFRAMES_PER_SECOND`; GO guarded the floor on plain
    `GENERALS_ONLINE`. `htree.cpp`'s static_assert accepts 30 or 60 without a GO include.
  - `Weapon.cpp` takes only the `delayToUse` clamp. GO's GattlingBuilding and QuadCannon
    name-matched rate hacks are ZH balance and are not taken.
  - `EMPUpdate.cpp` keeps `GameClientRandomValue` for the particle delay (GO switched to
    the logic RNG inside the 60 Hz guard; particle setup is client-side).
  - `ScriptEngine.cpp`: `adjustTimer` converts seconds with `BaseFps` like `setTimer`;
    GO only changed `setTimer`, which would have made "add 1 second" add 2 seconds.
  - `InGameUI.cpp` message fade: the fade amount is scaled by the frame multiplier and
    starts at the timeout. GO multiplied the timeout, which is 0 (integer math) at both
    rates, so its hunk changed nothing.
  - Not ported: GameLOD auto quality degrade (uncalled in go/main), the commented-out
    `seglinerenderer.cpp` block, `GENERALS_ONLINE_RUN_FAST` (dead in both trees).
  - Replays: GO has no rate tag. `replayMatchesGameVersion` already compares the exe CRC,
    which differs between any two builds, so a 30 Hz replay is refused by the existing
    check; no extra guard was needed.
  - Known upstream quirk left as is: `FRAME_GROUPING_CAP` is a `static int` in a header,
    so `NGMPGame.cpp`'s service-config write never reaches `Network.cpp`'s copy. The
    official client has the same behaviour, so parity wins over the fix.
- **Render cap policy**: GO's settings.json FPS limit and camera scroll speed govern an
  online match only. `NGMPGame::applyMatchRenderSettings()` snapshots Contra's values on
  first use and `restoreRenderSettings()` puts them back; `GameEngine::update()` calls one
  or the other every frame depending on whether a match is running, and the destructor
  restores too. GO applied its cap in the shell as well and set the Bool `m_useFpsLimit`
  from an integer FPS value; both are fixed here.
- **Observer overlay**: GO's `drawObserverStats` duplicates TSH's `drawPlayerInfoList`,
  so the TSH table is extended (SP, K, L, P columns, army name, red power value when
  short) instead. The notification feed is new. The army name comes from the player
  template, not GO's ZH side-string table, and GO's power-use table of ZH superweapon
  names is replaced by the command button label of the power. Milestones poll once a
  second from `update()` only while the observer bar is on, not from the draw path.
  The `GameWindowTransitionSpeedMultiplier` 1.0 to 2.5 default change that sits in the
  same OptionPreferences diff is not taken. GO's Shift+arrow font hotkeys are not taken;
  the font sizes are Options.ini keys.
- **Keyboard auto repeat dedupe** is guarded on `GENERALS_ONLINE` rather than taken
  unguarded, and GO's `KEY_REPEAT_DELAY_MSEC - KEY_REPEAT_INTERVAL_MSEC` sign flip is not
  taken.
- **StatsExporter/StatsUploader** are ported whole but every hunk outside the two new
  files is guarded on `GENERALS_ONLINE` (upstream is unguarded). GO's Player.cpp hook hunk
  also added `m_scoreKeeper.addMoneySpent(...)` for units, a scoring change; not taken.
  `-disableCommunityDataPatch` and the community patch BIG loader are not taken.
- **Widescreen**: the scaling divisors (ControlBarResizer, W3DHorizontalSlider, military
  subtitle) and the aspect-corrected camera height are in, under
  `GENERALS_ONLINE_WIDESCREEN`. GO's observer zoom clamp in `setHeightAboveGround` (max
  height forced to 500 or 1000) is not taken; the fork's lobby camera limit applies.
  GO ships no .wnd files in git; the 1280x720 layouts come from the official installer's
  `GeneralsOnlineGameData\`, which `winCreateFromScript` already prefers when ON. That
  preference also shadows the fork's script-patched `OptionsMenu.wnd`
  (`build/add_*_wnd.py`, 800x600 coordinates). Contra copies of those layouts at 1280x720
  are still to be made.
- **Crash guards taken unguarded** (pure null and bounds checks, comments trimmed):
  surfaceclass, render2dsentence, W3DTerrainTracks, W3DTreeBuffer, BaseHeightMap,
  W3DMouse (thread stopped before assets are freed, mutex held across the TheMouse check),
  FFmpegFile, FFmpegVideoPlayer, PopupReplay, ControlBar beacon template.
- **Not taken from the post-audit drift**: `GetConnectionType` to
  `GetDetailedConnectionStatus` (the vendored GNS carries GO's `GetConnectionType` vtable
  entry; the rename only matters for stock GNS), the `bittype.h` `uint32` typedef, and the
  FetchContent build migration.
- **Texture filtering kept**: `GENERALS_ONLINE_DISABLE_TEXTURE_FILTERING_AND_AA` is
  commented out and the W3DDisplay hunk that forces MSAA off was not taken - this fork
  has its own TextureFilter/AnisotropyLevel feature.
- **Sentry**: gate reuses GO's own `GENERALS_ONLINE_USE_SENTRY`, now default-off and
  extended to cover `InitSentry`'s body, `ShutdownSentry`, and the lib pragma (upstream
  ran sentry_init unconditionally in release builds).
- **Fingerprinting**: new `GENERALS_ONLINE_HW_FINGERPRINT` (default-off) gates machine
  GUID / MAC / volume serial in the auth payloads and the loaded-module report on the
  WS keepalive; fields are sent empty so the wire shape is unchanged.
- **Version/branding**: `version.cpp` product title/version hunks NOT taken (cosmetic;
  the backend gets `GENERALS_ONLINE_VERSION_STRING` directly from OnlineServices_Init).
  WinMain's `TheVersion->setVersion` GO variant IS taken (guarded) since the network
  version fields matter for matchmaking.
- **W3DView::setDefaultView**: takes GO's 4-arg signature under the macro for compile
  compatibility, but `bForceDefaultCam` is unused and GO's settings.json camera section
  (`DetermineCameraMaxHeight`, `Camera_GetMinHeight`) is not applied. The lobby's
  `max_cam_height` (host `/maxcameraheight`) IS honored, via `NGMPGame::SyncWithLobby` ->
  `GameInfo::m_maxCameraHeight` (`CH=` in the options string) ->
  `GameLogic::applyMaxCameraHeightForGame`. A lobby left at GO's default (310) plays the
  mod's own GameData `MaxCameraHeight`. Options.ini `UseCustomMaxCameraHeight` /
  `MaxCameraHeight` are personal and never affect GO games.
- **GO headers made self-sufficient**: upstream GO force-includes `PreRTS.h` into every
  TU via CMake PCH, which transitively provides `NextGenMP_defines.h`. This port keeps
  contraZH's PCH setup, so `NextGenMP_defines.h` is included explicitly where needed
  (GeneralsOnline_Settings.h, NGMPGame.h, ConnectionManager.h).
- **Deferred**: `GameSpyOpenOverlay` buddy bypass. (`SetLookAtPlayer` and the
  StatsExporter pipeline have since been ported.)
- Log-only hunks (NetworkLog conversions of commented DEBUG_LOGs), `isspace/isdigit`
  cast fixes, `nullptr`->`NULL` reverts, and GO's dead `#else` branches were not taken.

### Not taken in the 2026-10 sync

Range `9c1121bd5..6ff404436`, GO-authored commits only. The TSH commits GO merged arrive
with contraZH's own TSH syncs. Menu edits land in the `Menus/GeneralsOnline/` copies and
LobbyUtils.cpp edits in the GO whole-file copy.

| GO commit | Change | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| `a9aaa0ac2` `8e8d1cfe5` `4426d37cd` `7f113728c` `fb6cade08` `0ee25cc24` | vcpkg static networking deps, GNS fork with native ICE and WebRTC, CI, install and patch packaging | Vendored libs kept. The vendored header has the ICE implementation switch, and the service default (2, WebRTC) matches the vendored DLL |
| `4055d287b` | Camera reset to a cached default max height | The fork never widens the max height for observer free-zoom, and the cached value goes stale when the lobby or Options camera height calls `setMaxHeightAboveGround` |
| `ba7bf541f` `e2f439772` | Camera pitch keys (PgUp/PgDn/Home, numpad), minimum match pitch, slower keyboard rotation, rotate speed option | Unguarded changes to shared controls; would change offline Contra |
| `4bbd06b70` | Thread list exit guard in Except.cpp | Builds on GO's thread list lock rework, which was never ported |
| `8657eb2ef` `158104f1b` | Process-wide UTF-8 code page, Unicode window, AsciiString/UnicodeString conversion through the code page | Global encoding change for every build. `f73b0d1bc` (lobby map names as UTF-8) is taken; its helpers check `GetACP()` |
| `c6f585fb9` | VC++ runtime check that downloads and installs the redistributable | Unguarded startup code with a "Generals Online" dialog |
| `7322f0acc` `2e3e6b072` | Frameless startup splash window and hand-over | Unguarded WinMain and W3DDisplay changes at device creation |

Adapted while picking:

- `e629eb001` unbinds through `Set_DX8_Stream_Source`/`Set_DX8_Indices` so D3D9 compiles.
- `03b457c42` guards both rider paths of the multi-addon Overlord draw.
- `01cdd0cad` adds only the clamps; the surrounding tree code keeps contraZH's text.
- `d97cfd432` guards the new `ResolveGameListLobbyID` declaration in LobbyUtils.h.
- `dabb98b81` switches all six login URL sites of the pre-newserver flow to https.
- `d5124c304` leaves out the `/guard:cf` build flags; the plugin interface is compiled out.
- `6b4b0185c` turned `GENERALS_ONLINE_USE_PLUGINS_INTERFACE` back on in NextGenMP_defines.h and
  merged cleanly; it is commented out again. Check that define after every sync.

### Open: authenticated session is refused by the live service (as of 2026-08-26)

Where the bring-up currently stands against `api.playgenerals.online`:

- **Working**: `VersionCheck`, `MOTD`, the whole browser login flow. `CheckLogin` returns
  `result: 1` with a well formed JWT (`sub: 112094`, roles `Player`/`GameClient`,
  `iss: GeneralsOnline`, `aud: GeneralsOnline-Client`). The GO team confirmed the user
  row exists in their database, so login genuinely succeeds server side.
- **Failing**: every *authenticated* call is answered `401 invalid_token` - the
  `wss://api.playgenerals.online/ws` upgrade, `ServiceConfig`, and `RefreshToken` -
  using a token 18 seconds old with ~14 minutes of validity left. Ruled out by
  experiment: header format (`Bearer`/`bearer`/raw), token as `?access_token=` query
  param, `contract/1` vs `contract/2`, user agent, and rate limiting (unauthenticated
  endpoints answer 200 from the same machine at the same moment). The request shape
  matches the shipping official client, verified by comparing strings in
  `GeneralsOnlineZH_60.exe`.
- **Leading theory** (unproven - only GO's server logs can confirm): the session is only
  honored once the anticheat handshake completes. Their `OnLoginComplete` calls
  `AnticheatPlugInterface::Authenticate()` immediately before connecting the WebSocket;
  this fork compiles the plugin interface out, so that never runs. Their current
  anticheat is **GOAC** (`plugins/goanticheat/goanticheat.dll`), not EAC - the EAC
  references in their repo are historical. Alternative suspects visible in the token:
  `client_id: "0"` and an empty `display_name`.

Next step is a question for the GO team, not a code change - see
`FOR_GENERALSONLINE_DEVS.md` outside the repo. Note that enabling GOAC means loading a
closed source anticheat DLL into a Contra build, which is a deliberate decision, not a
default.

### Login flow: the repo is AHEAD of production

GO commit `27da5b89d` ("- New login flow", 2026-08-22) introduced a server issued login
code via a new `LoginCode` endpoint. Production does not serve it (hard 404) and the
shipping official client does not contain the string at all - it still uses the older
handshake: generate the gamecode client side, open the browser, poll `CheckLogin` with
`{code, client_id}`. The `pre-newserver` branch reverts
`OnlineServices_Auth.{h,cpp}` to `27da5b89d^` for that reason; `feature/go-port` keeps
the newer flow for when production catches up.

### Vendor DLL fix (found by crash triage)

Upstream GO's vendored `Vendor/ValveNetworkingSockets/abseil_dll.dll` (4.3 MB) does
not match the abseil the vendored `libprotobuf.dll` was built against - loading it
corrupts the heap inside protobuf's static initializer (0xc0000374 in `DllMain`,
before WinMain). GO never noticed because their POST_BUILD copies only
discord-rpc.dll; the working DLL set comes from their patcher. The vendored copy is
replaced here with the 1.8 MB `abseil_dll.dll` an official GeneralsOnline install
ships (byte-verified against `libprotobuf.dll`/`GameNetworkingSockets.dll`, which are
identical between the repo and the official install). Note the official install also
carries a 64-bit `zlib1.dll` for other tooling - do NOT take that one; the repo's
x86 `zlib1.dll` is correct for the game.

### UI phase decisions

- **Dual copies** live in `GUICallbacks/Menus/GeneralsOnline/`; CMake swaps them for the
  originals when the option is ON. Ported so far: WOLLoginMenu, WOLWelcomeMenu,
  WOLLobbyMenu, WOLGameSetupMenu, WOLMapSelectMenu, PopupHostGame, PopupJoinGame.
- **LobbyUtils.cpp** uses a whole-file dual instead of ~20 guarded hunks: the Core
  implementation is wrapped in `#if !defined(GENERALS_ONLINE)` and GO's rewritten copy
  compiles from the GO tree when ON. The shared LobbyUtils.h carries guarded enums.
- **W3DListBox** row-entry animation: when OFF, `rowDrawY` is a const alias of `drawY`
  (the one deliberate shared-text change that is not inside an `#if`; it is
  behavior-identical). GO's hardcoded green listbox background fill was NOT taken
  (visual restyle), nor were its unguarded null-check hunks in GadgetListBox.
- **GeneralsOnline_UIStubs.cpp** temporarily defines showNotificationBox,
  updateBuddyInfo and the GO-signature SetLookAtPlayer until WOLBuddyOverlay and
  PopupPlayerInfo are ported; delete the stubs with that phase.
- The GO menus' `#include "../X.h"` lines resolve through the Vendor `-I` entry
  (`Vendor/../` = the GeneralsOnline dir) - kept verbatim for diffability with GO.
- GO's menus reference only retail `.wnd` layout names; GO ships updated layouts as
  loose files under `GeneralsOnlineGameData\` which winCreateFromScript prefers when
  ON. Obtain that directory from a GO install/patcher for the full experience.
- **InGameChat gate adapted, not adopted**: an active NGMP game additionally allows
  the chat window; upstream GO allowed it ONLY then, which would have broken LAN chat
  and this fork's singleplayer chat-command window.
- **Skipped in the UI phases**: OptionsMenu hunks other than the observer font round
  trip (texture-filter guard is inert here, IP masking, GameSpy checks),
  SkirmishGameOptionsMenu's team-colored start positions (unguarded, and drops a bounds
  check), and Diplomacy's GO_REVEAL_TEAMS block (macro never defined).

## Fixes

Everything below was found after the port compiled, by running the client against the
live service. They fall into three groups, and the second one is a pattern worth
knowing before hunting the next crash.

### 1. Environment / vendored binaries

| Fix | Symptom | Cause |
|---|---|---|
| Replace vendored `abseil_dll.dll` | Process died before `WinMain` (`0xC0000374`) | The repo's abseil does not match the abseil its `libprotobuf.dll` was built against. See the vendor DLL section above. |
| Build with `/LARGEADDRESSAWARE` | Null deref in `TextureLoadTaskClass::Lock_Surfaces` during a single player load screen | 32 bit address space exhaustion, not the online code - see below. |

**The address space fix is not caused by this port, but the port provokes it.** The
crash was a null dereference in the stock WW3D texture loader: creating a 2048x2048
X8R8G8B8 surface for `ctrloadpageuserinterface.tga` (~16 MB contiguous) failed and
`Lock_Surfaces` used the result without checking it. A *full* dump (`CrashFZ`) was what
identified the cause - the process sat at **1.81 GB committed against the default 2 GB
limit**, with the remaining ~200 MB fragmented across 500+ regions, so the allocation
had nowhere to go. A mini dump would only have shown the null.

The online build links GameNetworkingSockets, protobuf, OpenSSL, libcurl and abseil,
which add real image and heap pressure to a process that was already close to the
ceiling with Contra's assets - so the online build reaches the limit sooner even though
no online code is on the stack. `/LARGEADDRESSAWARE` (in `GeneralsMD/Code/Main/
CMakeLists.txt`) raises the limit to 4 GB on 64 bit Windows and is a no-op on a 32 bit
OS. It is applied to **all** Zero Hour builds, not gated on the online option, because
the underlying pressure is the mod's asset load.

Note this raises the ceiling rather than making the loader tolerate a failed
allocation; the same line would crash the same way if 4 GB were ever exhausted. Adding
the null check as well is still open.

### 2. GameSpy singletons that GO redirects to NGMP (the recurring pattern)

**With the GO stack active, `SetUpGameSpy()` is compiled out, so `TheGameSpyInfo` and
`TheGameSpyGame` are never created.** Upstream GO rewrote every site that reads them to
use the NGMP equivalents instead. Where the port took a header change but missed the
matching body, the result is a null dereference that only appears once the UI flow
actually reaches that screen - so these surfaced one at a time, going deeper into the
online flow with each fix.

| Fix | Crash site | Redirect applied |
|---|---|---|
| Preference constructors (`Custom`, `QuickMatch`, `GameSpyMisc`, `Ignore`) | `CustomMatchPreferences::CustomMatchPreferences+0x7e` via `PopupHostGameInit` - clicking Host or Quick Match | `TheGameSpyInfo->getLocalProfileID()` -> NGMP auth user id, stored under `GeneralsOnlineData\` |
| `LoadScreen::didPlayerPreorder` | latent, would crash during an online match load | forced to `false` when GO is active |
| `GameLogic` game-info selection | `GameSpyLoadScreen::init+0xce` via `tryStartNewGame` - launching a hosted match | `TheGameInfo = TheGameSpyGame` -> `TheNGMPGame` for `GAME_INTERNET` |
| `Recorder` stats path | latent (`RTS_DEBUG` + `m_saveStats`) | same redirect, guarded on the services manager existing |
| `GameSpyLoadScreen::init` per-slot stats | `GameSpyLoadScreen::init+0x850`, same launch - the *next* null in the same function | `TheGameSpyPSMessageQueue->findPlayerStatsByID()` -> `NGMP_OnlineServices_StatsInterface::getPlayerStatsFromCache()` |

With that last one the full online path works end to end against the live service:
login -> lobby -> host -> launch -> in match.

Two details from the load screen fix worth keeping, because a straight line-for-line
port of the crashing statement would have been wrong:

- Upstream moves the stats fetch **above** the player-name block, because the name gets
  an Elo suffix in QuickMatch games (`name.format(L"%s (Elo: %d)", ...)`). The port had
  to reorder, not just guard.
- `GetAdditionalDisconnectsFromUserFile` is neither declared nor called when GO is on -
  its definition now lives only in the GO copy of `PopupPlayerInfo.cpp`.

**How to diagnose the next one.** The game writes its own dumps to
`Documents\Command and Conquer Generals Zero Hour Data\CrashDumps\` as
`CrashMZ-<date>-<commit>-pid<n>.dmp` (mini) and `CrashFZ-...` (full, ~1 GB) - *not* to
the Windows WER folder. **Do not trust the commit in that filename**: it is
`GitShortSHA1`, baked in when CMake last *configured*, so it goes stale across rebuilds
and does not identify the binary that crashed. Compare the faulting offset instead - a
crash that moved from `+0xce` to `+0x850` in the same function is a fix working, not a
fix failing. The mini dump plus the deployed `generalszh.pdb` is enough:

```
cdb.cmd -z "<CrashMZ dump>" -y "C:\Games\contra\contraprerelease;srv*<symcache>*https://msdl.microsoft.com/download/symbols"
.ecxr
kb 40
```

A null read of the form `mov eax,dword ptr [ecx] ds:002b:00000000` inside a function
whose name starts with `GameSpy` is almost certainly another instance of this pattern:
find the same function in the GO clone, take its `#if defined(GENERALS_ONLINE)` branch.

If the faulting function is *not* GameSpy related, reach for the **full** (`CrashFZ`)
dump instead. It carries the heap, so `!address -summary` shows memory pressure and
`dt` on the faulting object shows what was actually being loaded - that is how the
texture crash above was traced to address space exhaustion rather than a bad pointer.

### 3. Behavior differences from running a fork against the official service

| Fix | Reason |
|---|---|
| Report `anticheat_id = -1` (`NONE`) | Upstream's stub returns `0`, which is `GO_INTEGRATED_AC` - the client claimed to run GeneralsOnline's anticheat while running none. `IsPluginLoaded()`/`IsExternalProcessRunning()` were likewise hardcoded `true`. |
| `GENERALS_ONLINE_DISABLE_SELF_UPDATE` | The service reports "update needed" for this client, and the stock flow would download and run the official patcher over a Contra install. |
| Login link copied to clipboard, dialog reworded | `ShellExecute` opens the browser *behind* the game in exclusive fullscreen (upstream runs windowed-fullscreen, which this fork does not take), so the login appeared to fail silently. Applied at all three browser-open sites of the pre-newserver flow. |

## Triage of GO's non-online-tree changes (`git diff -w e760b3695..d7f75517d`,
## excluding `*GameNetwork/GeneralsOnline/*`; 361 files, +21522/-3744)

Categories: **A** = online-required, port (guarded). **B** = engine-feel fork, skip.
**C** = gameplay/balance ("community patch", mostly unguarded), skip. **D** = noise
(NULL-reverts, whitespace, typos), skip. **I** = infra/CI/packaging, skip.
**R** = review at the phase that touches it; default skip unless an A-hunk is found.

### A — port (UI, Phases 4-5)

Dual copies into `Menus/GeneralsOnline/`: WOLLoginMenu (140-265), WOLWelcomeMenu
(178-10), WOLLobbyMenu (1175-69), WOLGameSetupMenu (1743-425), WOLMapSelectMenu (54-16),
PopupHostGame (135-5), PopupJoinGame (34-6), WOLQuickMatchMenu (704-10), WOLBuddyOverlay
(659-6), PopupPlayerInfo (248-138), ScoreScreen (325-76).

In-place guards: MainMenu.cpp (4-1), OptionsMenu.cpp (23-1), InGameChat.cpp (7-0),
Diplomacy.cpp (15-1), DownloadMenu.cpp (35-1), GUIUtil.cpp (43-3), SkirmishGameOptionsMenu
(38-9, review), PopupReplay.cpp (3-0, review), LanGameOptionsMenu (2-2, review).

Stats (Phase 5): StatsExporter.{h,cpp} (44/864 new), StatsUploader.{h,cpp} (new).

### R — review on demand (pull minimally when the compiler asks, Phase 4)

GameWindowManager.{h,cpp} (259-256; GO also touched Generals copy), GadgetListBox.{h,cpp}
(110-0 / 8-0), W3DListBox (15-10), GadgetPushButton (11-2), GameWindowManagerScript
(22-1), GadgetTextEntry.h (1-0), GameWindow.h (2-1), AnimateWindowManager (4-1),
ControlBarPopupDescription (5-1), MapUtil.{h,cpp} (2-2 / 8-3), INIMapCache (2-1),
QuotedPrintable (8-8), SubsystemInterface (8-4), LanguageFilter (2-0), GameClient.{h,cpp}
(14-2 / 33-1), GlobalData.{h,cpp} (24-0 / 62-9 — mostly B, check for GO fields),
StackDump.cpp (3-2, Sentry-adjacent), WWLib/Except.cpp (75-2, Sentry crash handler —
only under GENERALS_ONLINE_SENTRY if ever), Core/GameEngine/CMakeLists.txt (5-10 —
re-implement by hand, never apply).

### B — engine-feel fork (mostly ported in the 60 Hz phase, see the decisions above)

Still skipped: GameMemory relocation, Intro (GO logo), dx8wrapper (windowed fullscreen,
d3d8 hook loader), texture filtering/AA off, GameLOD auto degrade, Except.cpp/Sentry,
MilesAudioManager and W3DVolumetricShadow (reformat only), W3DControlBar and
ControlBarPopupDescription (TSH reverts), the observer zoom clamp in W3DView.

Original list: GameMemory relocation (all GameMemory*/MemoryInit moves, Generals+MD), FramePacer,
FrameRateLimit, GameLOD.{h,cpp}, GameDefines.h, GameCommon.h, ReplaySimulation,
Intro.{h,cpp}, LoadScreen, CommandXlat, MetaEvent, Keyboard, W3DMouse, W3DView,
dx8wrapper, surfaceclass, render2dsentence, seglinerenderer, W3DVolumetricShadow,
W3DTerrainTracks, W3DTreeBuffer, W3DTankTruckDraw, W3DTruckDraw, W3DControlBar,
W3DHorizontalSlider, MilesAudioManager, FFmpeg*, GameAudio, ParticleSys,
ArchiveFileSystem.{h,cpp}, UserPreferences, OptionPreferences.{h,cpp}, View.h,
RadiusDecal, Drawable.cpp, ControlBar/ControlBarScheme/ControlBarResizer, Shell.cpp
(pure noise), Radar.cpp, Eva.cpp.

### C — skip (gameplay/balance, mostly unguarded)

All GameLogic/Object, GameLogic/AI, ScriptEngine bulk (ScriptEngine.cpp 341-248,
ScriptActions, ScriptConditions, Scripts), Weapon.cpp, EMPUpdate, TurretAI,
HelicopterSlowDeathUpdate, NeutronMissileUpdate, DeployStyleAIUpdate(+h), DeletionUpdate
(+h), JetSlowDeathBehavior, SlavedUpdate, MissileLauncherBuildingUpdate, PhysicsUpdate,
ParachuteContain, SpecialPowerModule, ObjectCreationList, Object.cpp, AI.cpp, FXList,
RankInfo, CrateSystem, Science, SidesList, Team, Player, CampaignManager, StateMachine,
SwayClientUpdate, ExperienceTracker.h, PerfTimer.h, Overridable.h,
ParkingPlaceBehavior.h, AcademyStats.h, GameStateMap/GameState, INIWebpageURL,
Compression (NoxCompress, EAC), AsciiString, INI.cpp, Debug.cpp.

### Skip wholesale

- All of `Generals/Code/**` (GO is ZH-only; vanilla Generals keeps GameSpy always).
- Infra: .github/workflows/*, resources/dockerbuild-msvc/*, scripts/*, PatchNotes/*,
  MakePatch.ps1, CMakePresets.json hunks, RTS.RC, Generals.ico, .gitignore,
  .editorconfig.
- Vendored-but-dead NAT libs: `Vendor/{miniupnpc,libplum,libnatpmp}` (35 files — not in
  GO's source lists, never included).
- GO's `GeneralsMD/Code/GameEngine/CMakeLists.txt` diff (86-7) and Main/CMakeLists.txt
  rename — contraZH's CMake is hand-edited instead.
